I wrote this application only for learning purposes. It is wrotten with help of spring boot.
If you want start this aplication , you need to install your own mySql server and add 
path into application.properties file or you can use embedded h2 database (you need configure h2 console too).
This app allows to searching, saving , deleting , modifying records in a database.
